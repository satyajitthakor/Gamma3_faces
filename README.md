# Distribution Construction Approaches for Constrained Entropy Vectors and Converse Results ($\Gamma_{3}^*$)

The codes calculate and visualize the following:

- Valid region where the inequalities are satisfied.
- Boundaries of the inequalities.

## 3D Visualizations of Vectors and Inequalities

### Requirements

To run 3D visualization codes, you need to install the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**: For numerical calculations.
- **Plotly**: For obtaining the 3D visualizations.

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy plotly
```
