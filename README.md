## 3D Visualization of Vectors and Inequalities

The code calculates and visualizes the following:

- Valid region where the inequalities are satisfied.
- Boundaries of the inequalities.


## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy plotly
```
