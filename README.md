## 3D Visualization of Vectors and Inequalities

The code calculates and visualizes the following:

- Valid region where the inequalities are satisfied.
- Boundaries of the inequalities.
- Intersection points between different inequalities.
- Dotted lines that represent various critical data points in the 3D space.
- A specific marked point in the 3D space, highlighted in blue.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy plotly
```
